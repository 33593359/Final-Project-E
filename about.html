    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>Our Park was once home to the Navajo Indian tribes who sold the land in 1832 to a Mr. William Flabanabba for $50 so he could build a beautful cabin home near the shores of Lake Flabanabba. The land was rich in gold and other valuables and was later again sold to the U.S. government in 1912 for that very reason. Once the government was finished with the land, they gave the land to the National Park Services who protect the park and all it's wildlife while also hosting hundreds of visitors each year. Our park is the largest in the state and we pride ourselves on keeping our park clean and respecting the wildlife that inhabit this great land.
